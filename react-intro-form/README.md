1) Project Setup:
- Create a new github repo called react-intro-form with the following options:
	- Clone the repo to your computer and add the link to populi
- cd into the react-intro-form directory
- Run 'npx create-react-app .' to initialize react in the repository
- Run 'npm start' after react has finished installing
- If the above worked properly, you should see the react start page on localhost:3000
- Open App.js and replace the App functional component with this code:
	- function App() {
			return (
				<div className="App App-header">
					
				</div>
			);
		}

2) Creating the <MovieForm/> Component:
- Create a new functional component called MovieForm
	- Be sure to include props as the first function parameter and be sure to have a single enclosing <div> tag in the JSX of the return statement
- Add a title to the JSX of the MovieForm component inside the <div></div> tags
	- <h1>Movie Form</h1>
- Add <MovieForm/> as a new component inside of the JSX of the <App /> component between the two <div> tags
	- <div className="App App-header">
      <MovieForm />
    </div>
- If you did this right, then on localhost:3000, you should see the heading "Movie Form" on the page

3) Building out <MovieForm/>:
- At the top of the App.js file, import useState from react
	- import { useState } from "react";
- Add a new state variable to <MovieForm/> called "title" along with its setter function "setTitle" initalized to an empty string:
	- const [title, setTitle] = useState("")
- In the JSX of <MovieForm/> (inside the enclosing divs), add a new text input field and a label that says "Title:"
	- return (
			<div>
				<label>Title:</label>
				<input type="text" />
			</div>
		)
- In the input field you just created, add an onChange handler that will call setTitle with the value from the onChange event
	- <input type="text" onChange={(event)=>{
			setTitle(event.target.value)
		}}/>
	- If this event handler works, it should update the title state variable with the new value entered into the text field. 
	- [Optional]: The easiest way to check that it is working is to add a console.log of title between the title state variable definition and the JSX return statement of <MovieForm/>
		- const [title, setTitle] = useState("")
			console.log(title)
			return (
				/* ...JSX of MovieForm */
			)
- Display the current value of title in the JSX of <MovieForm/> in <p> tags so that you/the user can see the value of title update in real time
	- return (
			<div>
				<label>Title:</label>
				<input type="text" onChange={(e)=>{
					setTitle(e.target.value)
				}}/>
				<p>Current Title: {title}</p>
			</div>
		)
- If you did the above correctly, you should be able to type into the title text input field and see the current title update as you type

4) Implement Additional <MovieForm/> fields:
- In <MovieForm/> repeat the process in step 3 to add the following type="text" input fields to the form:
	- director, actors, plot 
	- _Note_: Since these are type="text" input fields, the state variables for director, actors, plot should be initalized to an empty string: ""
- In <MovieForm/> repeat the process in step 3 to add the following type="number" input fields to the form:
	- year, imdbRating
	- _Note_: 
		- For these two input fields, the state variables should be initialized to 0. 
		- For the imdbRating input field, add the attribute step="0.1" to it so that you can increment the value by a tenth at a time.
			- <input type="number" step="0.1" />
